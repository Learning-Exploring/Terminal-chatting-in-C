# A terminal Chatting Application in C ðŸ“–

Here I tried to explore the Socket and TCP. Although my understanding of them is not well enough, building something with them was really satisfying.

The nature of socket goes in one way communication. When a server listens, a client writes and vise versa. 

Thus, I plan to implement threading to allow subsequent chats from a server or a client in the future to learn more about concurrency in C.
